<h1>PhotoShrink — Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated: January 2026</strong></p>

<p>PhotoShrink respects your privacy. We do not collect, store, or share any personal data. All photo processing happens entirely on your device.</p>

<h2>Information We Access</h2>
<p>PhotoShrink requires permission to access your photo library solely so you can select and compress photos. Selected images remain on your device and are not uploaded to any server operated by us.</p>

<h2>Google Photos Upload</h2>
<p>If you choose to upload compressed photos to Google Photos, authentication and upload occur through Google's secure API. PhotoShrink does not store your Google credentials or photos.</p>

  ## Google User Data

### Data Accessed

### Data Usage

### Data Sharing
<p>PhotoShrink does not share Google user data with any third parties.</p>

### Data Storage & Protection
<p>PhotoShrink does not store Google user data on external servers. Photos are processed locally on the device and transferred directly to Google Photos using secure Google APIs.</p>

### Data Retention & Deletion
<p>PhotoShrink does not retain Google user data. Users can revoke Google Photos access at any time from their Google Account settings. No Google user data is stored by the app after upload.</p>
